# Hand-Written-Digits-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

Built a Neural Network to recognise hand written digits on MNIST dataset from Scratch

Applied different Activation Function and loss function like MSE and Cross Entropy for comparing results

Implemented Weight Initialisation, Regularisation and Dropout and achieved an Accuracy of 97%
